# Finlandsswedish pronounciation lexicon

The Finlandsswedish pronounciation lexicon has been published (June 11th 2025) by Finlands svenska taltidningsf√∂rening rf (FSTF rf, aka The Association of Swedish Talking Newspapers in Finland) under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Legal Code, https://github.com/fstfrf/Lexicon?tab=CC0-1.0-1-ov-file

That said, the FSTF r.f. is a non-profit organization producing and distributing talking newspapers to swedishspeaking visually impaired and print disabled in Finland, and would appreciate that any developments to or based on the lexicon would be given back to the association, improving the accessibility for people with print disabilites.
